# DBMS-Mini-Project-Weather-Reporting-System
Basic mini project for weather reporting system, where everyone can add details of their city. No special admin privileges are given. 
Just import the zip file into netbeans and you will be ready to go, Netbeans IDE 8 is recommended and install xampp and run the MySQL and import the sql file in the phpMyAdmin and backend will be ready.
You need to add jar file in the netbeans library in order to connect the front and the back end.
Rest figure out on your own.
# Thank you
